You: You're launched high into the atmosphere! The apex of your trajectory just barely reaches the surface of a large island floating in the sky. You gently land in a fluffy pile of leaves. It's quite cold, but you don't see much snow. An Elf runs over to greet you.

The Elf explains that you've arrived at Snow Island and apologizes for the lack of snow. He'll be happy to explain the situation, but it's a bit of a walk, so you have some time. They don't get many visitors up here; would you like to play a game in the meantime?

As you walk, the Elf shows you a small bag and some cubes which are either red, green, or blue. Each time you play this game, he will hide a secret number of cubes of each color in the bag, and your goal is to figure out information about the number of cubes.

To get information, once a bag has been loaded with cubes, the Elf will reach into the bag, grab a handful of random cubes, show them to you, and then put them back in the bag. He'll do this a few times per game.

You play several games and record the information from each game (your puzzle input). Each game is listed with its ID number (like the 11 in Game 11: ...) followed by a semicolon-separated list of subsets of cubes that were revealed from the bag (like 3 red, 5 green, 4 blue).

For example, the record of a few games might look like this:

Game 1: 3 blue, 4 red; 1 red, 2 green, 6 blue; 2 green
Game 2: 1 blue, 2 green; 3 green, 4 blue, 1 red; 1 green, 1 blue
Game 3: 8 green, 6 blue, 20 red; 5 blue, 4 red, 13 green; 5 green, 1 red
Game 4: 1 green, 3 red, 6 blue; 3 green, 6 red; 3 green, 15 blue, 14 red
Game 5: 6 red, 1 blue, 3 green; 2 blue, 1 red, 2 green

In game 1, three sets of cubes are revealed from the bag (and then put back again). The first set is 3 blue cubes and 4 red cubes; the second set is 1 red cube, 2 green cubes, and 6 blue cubes; the third set is only 2 green cubes.

The Elf would first like to know which games would have been possible if the bag contained only 12 red cubes, 13 green cubes, and 14 blue cubes?

In the example above, games 1, 2, and 5 would have been possible if the bag had been loaded with that configuration. However, game 3 would have been impossible because at one point the Elf showed you 20 red cubes at once; similarly, game 4 would also have been impossible because the Elf showed you 15 blue cubes at once. If you add up the IDs of the games that would have been possible, you get 8.

Determine which games would have been possible if the bag had been loaded with only 12 red cubes, 13 green cubes, and 14 blue cubes. What is the sum of the IDs of those games?

Write a python script to perform this task.

ChatGPT: To write a Python script that solves this puzzle, we need to process the input to identify which games are possible with the given configuration of cubes (12 red, 13 green, 14 blue). The script will:

1. Read each game's details from the input.
2. For each game, check if any subset of cubes shown exceeds the available number of cubes in the bag.
3. If a game is possible with the given cube configuration, sum up its ID.
Here's a Python script that implements this logic:

def is_game_possible(game_details, red_cubes, green_cubes, blue_cubes):
    for subset in game_details:
        if subset['red'] > red_cubes or subset['green'] > green_cubes or subset['blue'] > blue_cubes:
            return False
    return True

def process_games(input_data):
    games = input_data.split('\n')
    possible_games_sum = 0

    for game in games:
        game_id, subsets = game.split(':')
        game_id = int(game_id.replace('Game', '').strip())
        subset_details = subsets.split(';')
        game_details = []

        for subset in subset_details:
            details = {'red': 0, 'green': 0, 'blue': 0}
            for color_info in subset.strip().split(','):
                number, color = color_info.strip().split()
                details[color] = int(number)
            game_details.append(details)

        if is_game_possible(game_details, 12, 13, 14):
            possible_games_sum += game_id

    return possible_games_sum

# Example usage
input_data = """Game 1: 3 blue, 4 red; 1 red, 2 green, 6 blue; 2 green
Game 2: 1 blue, 2 green; 3 green, 4 blue, 1 red; 1 green, 1 blue
Game 3: 8 green, 6 blue, 20 red; 5 blue, 4 red, 13 green; 5 green, 1 red
Game 4: 1 green, 3 red, 6 blue; 3 green, 6 red; 3 green, 15 blue, 14 red
Game 5: 6 red, 1 blue, 3 green; 2 blue, 1 red, 2 green"""

result = process_games(input_data)
print("Sum of IDs of possible games:", result)

This script should correctly identify which games are possible with the specified cube configuration and calculate the sum of their IDs. Make sure to replace the input_data string with the actual input for the task.

You: Change the script to take the input from a file.

ChatGPT: 
To adapt the script to read input from a file, we'll modify it to open a specified file and read the game details from there. Here's the updated script:

def is_game_possible(game_details, red_cubes, green_cubes, blue_cubes):
    for subset in game_details:
        if subset['red'] > red_cubes or subset['green'] > green_cubes or subset['blue'] > blue_cubes:
            return False
    return True

def process_games_from_file(file_path):
    possible_games_sum = 0

    with open(file_path, 'r') as file:
        for line in file:
            if not line.strip():
                continue  # Skip empty lines

            game_id, subsets = line.split(':')
            game_id = int(game_id.replace('Game', '').strip())
            subset_details = subsets.split(';')
            game_details = []

            for subset in subset_details:
                details = {'red': 0, 'green': 0, 'blue': 0}
                for color_info in subset.strip().split(','):
                    number, color = color_info.strip().split()
                    details[color] = int(number)
                game_details.append(details)

            if is_game_possible(game_details, 12, 13, 14):
                possible_games_sum += game_id

    return possible_games_sum

# Example usage
file_path = 'input.txt'  # Replace 'input.txt' with the path to your input file
result = process_games_from_file(file_path)
print("Sum of IDs of possible games:", result)

This script will read the game details from the file specified in file_path and process them as before. Ensure that the input file is correctly formatted and contains the game details.

You: That's the right answer! You are one gold star closer to restoring snow operations.

ChatGPT: Great to hear that the solution was correct! I'm here to help with any more challenges or tasks you have. Let's continue working towards restoring snow operations. üåüüå®Ô∏è

You: The Elf says they've stopped producing snow because they aren't getting any water! He isn't sure why the water stopped; however, he can show you how to get to the water source to check it out for yourself. It's just up ahead!

As you continue your walk, the Elf poses a second question: in each game you played, what is the fewest number of cubes of each color that could have been in the bag to make the game possible?

Again consider the example games from earlier:

Game 1: 3 blue, 4 red; 1 red, 2 green, 6 blue; 2 green
Game 2: 1 blue, 2 green; 3 green, 4 blue, 1 red; 1 green, 1 blue
Game 3: 8 green, 6 blue, 20 red; 5 blue, 4 red, 13 green; 5 green, 1 red
Game 4: 1 green, 3 red, 6 blue; 3 green, 6 red; 3 green, 15 blue, 14 red
Game 5: 6 red, 1 blue, 3 green; 2 blue, 1 red, 2 green
In game 1, the game could have been played with as few as 4 red, 2 green, and 6 blue cubes. If any color had even one fewer cube, the game would have been impossible.
Game 2 could have been played with a minimum of 1 red, 3 green, and 4 blue cubes.
Game 3 must have been played with at least 20 red, 13 green, and 6 blue cubes.
Game 4 required at least 14 red, 3 green, and 15 blue cubes.
Game 5 needed no fewer than 6 red, 3 green, and 2 blue cubes in the bag.
The power of a set of cubes is equal to the numbers of red, green, and blue cubes multiplied together. The power of the minimum set of cubes in game 1 is 48. In games 2-5 it was 12, 1560, 630, and 36, respectively. Adding up these five powers produces the sum 2286.

For each game, find the minimum set of cubes that must have been present. What is the sum of the power of these sets?

ChatGPT: Write a python script to perform this task.

To solve this new problem, we need to calculate the minimum number of each color of cube required to make each game possible, and then find the product (power) of these numbers for each game. The total we seek is the sum of these products for all games.

Here's the Python script to achieve this:

Read and parse each game's details as before.
For each game, find the maximum number of each color cube shown in any subset.
Calculate the product of these maximum numbers for each game.
Sum these products to get the final result.

Here is the script:

def process_minimum_cubes_from_file(file_path):
    total_power = 0

    with open(file_path, 'r') as file:
        for line in file:
            if not line.strip():
                continue  # Skip empty lines

            _, subsets = line.split(':')
            max_red, max_green, max_blue = 0, 0, 0

            for subset in subsets.split(';'):
                red, green, blue = 0, 0, 0
                for color_info in subset.strip().split(','):
                    number, color = color_info.strip().split()
                    if color == 'red':
                        red = int(number)
                    elif color == 'green':
                        green = int(number)
                    elif color == 'blue':
                        blue = int(number)
                
                max_red = max(max_red, red)
                max_green = max(max_green, green)
                max_blue = max(max_blue, blue)

            game_power = max_red * max_green * max_blue
            total_power += game_power

    return total_power

# Example usage
file_path = 'input.txt'  # Replace 'input.txt' with the path to your input file
result = process_minimum_cubes_from_file(file_path)
print("Sum of the power of the minimum sets:", result)


This script calculates the minimum number of cubes required for each color in each game and then computes their product. The total sum of these products gives the final answer. Ensure the input file contains the correct data.
