''' Prompt
User
That's not the right answer; your answer is too low. 
This looks very similar to the previous one. In reviewing the sub-function extract_digits, 
it appears you are finding the word, but not necessarily the "first" or the "last" word 
that represent digits. How could this function be updated to ensure that it is always the 
first word or first digit and the last word or last digit being used.
