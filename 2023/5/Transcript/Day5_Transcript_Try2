You: --- Day 5: If You Give A Seed A Fertilizer ---
You take the boat and find the gardener right where you were told he would be: managing a giant "garden" that looks more to you like a farm.

"A water source? Island Island is the water source!" You point out that Snow Island isn't receiving any water.

"Oh, we had to stop the water because we ran out of sand to filter it with! Can't make snow with dirty water. Don't worry, I'm sure we'll get more sand soon; we only turned off the water a few days... weeks... oh no." His face sinks into a look of horrified realization.

"I've been so busy making sure everyone here has food that I completely forgot to check why we stopped getting more sand! There's a ferry leaving soon that is headed over in that direction - it's much faster than your boat. Could you please go check it out?"

You barely have time to agree to this request when he brings up another. "While you wait for the ferry, maybe you can help us with our food production problem. The latest Island Island Almanac just arrived and we're having trouble making sense of it."

The almanac (your puzzle input) lists all of the seeds that need to be planted. It also lists what type of soil to use with each kind of seed, what type of fertilizer to use with each kind of soil, what type of water to use with each kind of fertilizer, and so on. Every type of seed, soil, fertilizer and so on is identified with a number, but numbers are reused by each category - that is, soil 123 and fertilizer 123 aren't necessarily related to each other.

For example:

seeds: 79 14 55 13

seed-to-soil map:
50 98 2
52 50 48

soil-to-fertilizer map:
0 15 37
37 52 2
39 0 15

fertilizer-to-water map:
49 53 8
0 11 42
42 0 7
57 7 4

water-to-light map:
88 18 7
18 25 70

light-to-temperature map:
45 77 23
81 45 19
68 64 13

temperature-to-humidity map:
0 69 1
1 0 69

humidity-to-location map:
60 56 37
56 93 4
The almanac starts by listing which seeds need to be planted: seeds 79, 14, 55, and 13.

The rest of the almanac contains a list of maps which describe how to convert numbers from a source category into numbers in a destination category. That is, the section that starts with seed-to-soil map: describes how to convert a seed number (the source) to a soil number (the destination). This lets the gardener and his team know which soil to use with which seeds, which water to use with which fertilizer, and so on.

Rather than list every source number and its corresponding destination number one by one, the maps describe entire ranges of numbers that can be converted. Each line within a map contains three numbers: the destination range start, the source range start, and the range length.

Consider again the example seed-to-soil map:

50 98 2
52 50 48
The first line has a destination range start of 50, a source range start of 98, and a range length of 2. This line means that the source range starts at 98 and contains two values: 98 and 99. The destination range is the same length, but it starts at 50, so its two values are 50 and 51. With this information, you know that seed number 98 corresponds to soil number 50 and that seed number 99 corresponds to soil number 51.

The second line means that the source range starts at 50 and contains 48 values: 50, 51, ..., 96, 97. This corresponds to a destination range starting at 52 and also containing 48 values: 52, 53, ..., 98, 99. So, seed number 53 corresponds to soil number 55.

Any source numbers that aren't mapped correspond to the same destination number. So, seed number 10 corresponds to soil number 10.

So, the entire list of seed numbers and their corresponding soil numbers looks like this:

seed  soil
0     0
1     1
...   ...
48    48
49    49
50    52
51    53
...   ...
96    98
97    99
98    50
99    51
With this map, you can look up the soil number required for each initial seed number:

Seed number 79 corresponds to soil number 81.
Seed number 14 corresponds to soil number 14.
Seed number 55 corresponds to soil number 57.
Seed number 13 corresponds to soil number 13.
The gardener and his team want to get started as soon as possible, so they'd like to know the closest location that needs a seed. Using these maps, find the lowest location number that corresponds to any of the initial seeds. To do this, you'll need to convert each seed number through other categories until you can find its corresponding location number. In this example, the corresponding types are:

Seed 79, soil 81, fertilizer 81, water 81, light 74, temperature 78, humidity 78, location 82.
Seed 14, soil 14, fertilizer 53, water 49, light 42, temperature 42, humidity 43, location 43.
Seed 55, soil 57, fertilizer 57, water 53, light 46, temperature 82, humidity 82, location 86.
Seed 13, soil 13, fertilizer 52, water 41, light 34, temperature 34, humidity 35, location 35.
So, the lowest location number in this example is 35.

What is the lowest location number that corresponds to any of the initial seed numbers?

Write a python script to solve this task. It MUST run on the example data provided, but have the functionality to receive input data from a file 'almanac.txt'. Provide this script.

ChatGPT: To solve this task, we need to create a Python script that can process the almanac data and find the lowest location number corresponding to any of the initial seed numbers. We'll approach this step by step:

Parsing the Data: We'll write a function to read and parse the almanac data, either from the provided example or from a file named 'almanac.txt'.

Mapping Functionality: We'll create a function to handle the mapping from one category to another, as described in the puzzle.

Processing the Seeds: We'll process each seed through the various stages (soil, fertilizer, water, etc.) until we reach the location numbers.

Finding the Lowest Location Number: Finally, we'll find the lowest location number among all processed seeds.

Let's start by writing the initial part of the script, which includes reading and parsing the data. We'll focus on parsing the example data first and then add the functionality to read from a file.

Here's the first part of the script:

def parse_almanac(data):
    sections = data.split('\n\n')
    seeds = [int(x) for x in sections[0].split(': ')[1].split()]
    
    maps = {}
    for section in sections[1:]:
        title, *lines = section.split('\n')
        category = title.split('-to-')[0]
        maps[category] = [tuple(map(int, line.split())) for line in lines]
    
    return seeds, maps

def map_value(value, category_map):
    for dest_start, src_start, length in category_map:
        if src_start <= value < src_start + length:
            return dest_start + (value - src_start)
    return value

def process_seed(seed, maps):
    categories = ["seed", "soil", "fertilizer", "water", "light", "temperature", "humidity", "location"]
    value = seed
    for category in categories:
        value = map_value(value, maps.get(category, []))
    return value

# Example data (later this will be replaced with file reading)
example_data = """

seeds, maps = parse_almanac(example_data.strip())
locations = [process_seed(seed, maps) for seed in seeds]
lowest_location = min(locations)

print("Lowest location number:", lowest_location)

This script will parse the example data, process each seed through the various mappings, and print the lowest location number. Next, we can modify it to read from 'almanac.txt'. Would you like to proceed with this, or do you have any modifications or specific requirements for the next steps?

You: Yes, that worked correctly for the example data. Continue.

ChatGPT: Great! Now that we've confirmed the script works with the example data, the next step is to modify it to read the almanac data from a file named 'almanac.txt'. We'll add a function to handle file reading and integrate it into our existing script.

Here's the updated script:

def read_almanac_from_file(file_path):
    with open(file_path, 'r') as file:
        return file.read()

def parse_almanac(data):
    sections = data.split('\n\n')
    seeds = [int(x) for x in sections[0].split(': ')[1].split()]
    
    maps = {}
    for section in sections[1:]:
        title, *lines = section.split('\n')
        category = title.split('-to-')[0]
        maps[category] = [tuple(map(int, line.split())) for line in lines]
    
    return seeds, maps

def map_value(value, category_map):
    for dest_start, src_start, length in category_map:
        if src_start <= value < src_start + length:
            return dest_start + (value - src_start)
    return value

def process_seed(seed, maps):
    categories = ["seed", "soil", "fertilizer", "water", "light", "temperature", "humidity", "location"]
    value = seed
    for category in categories:
        value = map_value(value, maps.get(category, []))
    return value

# Read data from 'almanac.txt'
almanac_data = read_almanac_from_file('almanac.txt')

seeds, maps = parse_almanac(almanac_data.strip())
locations = [process_seed(seed, maps) for seed in seeds]
lowest_location = min(locations)

print("Lowest location number:", lowest_location)

This script will read the almanac data from 'almanac.txt', process the seeds, and output the lowest location number. Make sure to have the 'almanac.txt' file in the same directory as your script, or provide the correct path to the file.

Would you like to test this script with an actual 'almanac.txt' file, or do you have any other requirements or modifications?

You: When I put the value, returned from this script, into the Advent of Code website this message was returned, "That's the right answer! You are one gold star closer to restoring snow operations."
--- Part Two ---
Everyone will starve if you only plant such a small number of seeds. Re-reading the almanac, it looks like the seeds: line actually describes ranges of seed numbers.

The values on the initial seeds: line come in pairs. Within each pair, the first value is the start of the range and the second value is the length of the range. So, in the first line of the example above:

seeds: 79 14 55 13
This line describes two ranges of seed numbers to be planted in the garden. The first range starts with seed number 79 and contains 14 values: 79, 80, ..., 91, 92. The second range starts with seed number 55 and contains 13 values: 55, 56, ..., 66, 67.

Now, rather than considering four seed numbers, you need to consider a total of 27 seed numbers.

In the above example, the lowest location number can be obtained from seed number 82, which corresponds to soil 84, fertilizer 84, water 84, light 77, temperature 45, humidity 46, and location 46. So, the lowest location number is 46.

Consider all of the initial seed numbers listed in the ranges on the first line of the almanac. What is the lowest location number that corresponds to any of the initial seed numbers?

ChatGPT: For Part Two of the challenge, we need to modify our script to handle ranges of seed numbers instead of individual seed numbers. We'll update the parse_almanac function to generate a list of seed numbers based on the ranges provided. Each pair of numbers in the seeds: line represents the start of the range and the length of the range.

Here's the updated script to handle this change:

def read_almanac_from_file(file_path):
    with open(file_path, 'r') as file:
        return file.read()

def parse_almanac(data):
    sections = data.split('\n\n')
    seed_ranges = [int(x) for x in sections[0].split(': ')[1].split()]
    
    seeds = []
    for i in range(0, len(seed_ranges), 2):
        start, length = seed_ranges[i], seed_ranges[i + 1]
        seeds.extend(range(start, start + length))

    maps = {}
    for section in sections[1:]:
        title, *lines = section.split('\n')
        category = title.split('-to-')[0]
        maps[category] = [tuple(map(int, line.split())) for line in lines]
    
    return seeds, maps

def map_value(value, category_map):
    for dest_start, src_start, length in category_map:
        if src_start <= value < src_start + length:
            return dest_start + (value - src_start)
    return value

def process_seed(seed, maps):
    categories = ["seed", "soil", "fertilizer", "water", "light", "temperature", "humidity", "location"]
    value = seed
    for category in categories:
        value = map_value(value, maps.get(category, []))
    return value

# Read data from 'almanac.txt'
almanac_data = read_almanac_from_file('almanac.txt')

seeds, maps = parse_almanac(almanac_data.strip())
locations = [process_seed(seed, maps) for seed in seeds]
lowest_location = min(locations)

print("Lowest location number:", lowest_location)

In this version, the script will consider all seed numbers in the specified ranges and find the lowest location number among them. Make sure the 'almanac.txt' file is formatted correctly with the new interpretation of the seed ranges.

You can now test this script with your 'almanac.txt' file to see if it produces the correct answer for Part Two of the challenge. Let me know if there are any other modifications or features you'd like to include!

Although this appears correct, the almanac file includes very large numbers and therefore very large ranges. In the parse_almanac function, let's look at the functionality associated with getting the seed ranges. Instead of creating a complete seed map, have the script simply only create an sorted list of the seed ranges from the input data. Have it print this list out afterwards. 
ONLY provide this functionality change. DO NOT change any other code, yet.


Understood. I'll modify the parse_almanac function in the script to generate and print a sorted list of seed ranges, rather than expanding them into a full list of seeds. This change will allow us to handle large numbers and ranges more efficiently.

Here's the updated part of the script with this specific change:

def parse_almanac(data):
    sections = data.split('\n\n')
    seed_ranges_raw = [int(x) for x in sections[0].split(': ')[1].split()]
    
    seed_ranges = [(seed_ranges_raw[i], seed_ranges_raw[i] + seed_ranges_raw[i + 1]) for i in range(0, len(seed_ranges_raw), 2)]
    seed_ranges.sort()

    maps = {}
    for section in sections[1:]:
        title, *lines = section.split('\n')
        category = title.split('-to-')[0]
        maps[category] = [tuple(map(int, line.split())) for line in lines]
    
    return seed_ranges, maps

# Read data from 'almanac.txt'
almanac_data = read_almanac_from_file('almanac.txt')

seed_ranges, maps = parse_almanac(almanac_data.strip())

print("Seed ranges:", seed_ranges)

This modification will generate a sorted list of seed ranges (as tuples of start and end) and print this list. It will be more efficient for large ranges and will serve as a basis for further processing steps.

You can test this part to see how it handles the seed ranges from your 'almanac.txt' file.

You: Next, let's sort the map data as well. Each map section should be ordered by the source location. Update the functionality to do this, and print the results for each section. 
ONLY provide this functionality change. DO NOT change any other code, yet.

Understood. I'll modify the script to sort each map section by the source location. This will involve updating the parse_almanac function to sort the tuples in each map based on their source start value.

Here's the updated section of the script to implement this change:

def parse_almanac(data):
    sections = data.split('\n\n')
    seed_ranges_raw = [int(x) for x in sections[0].split(': ')[1].split()]
    
    seed_ranges = [(seed_ranges_raw[i], seed_ranges_raw[i] + seed_ranges_raw[i + 1]) for i in range(0, len(seed_ranges_raw), 2)]
    seed_ranges.sort()

    maps = {}
    for section in sections[1:]:
        title, *lines = section.split('\n')
        category = title.split('-to-')[0]
        map_data = [tuple(map(int, line.split())) for line in lines]
        map_data.sort(key=lambda x: x[1])  # Sort by source start value
        maps[category] = map_data
    
    return seed_ranges, maps

# Read data from 'almanac.txt'
almanac_data = read_almanac_from_file('almanac.txt')

seed_ranges, maps = parse_almanac(almanac_data.strip())

print("Seed ranges:", seed_ranges)
for category, map_data in maps.items():
    print(f"{category}-to map sorted:", map_data)

This modification will sort each map section by the source start value and then print the sorted map data for each category. You can run this updated script to see the sorted map data for each section in your 'almanac.txt' file.

You: Great! Next we need to fill in the map sections to cover all the ranges that are possible. For example in the seed-to-soil map we have this list '[(52, 50, 48), (50, 98, 2)]' This list if it were complete would be '[(0, 0, 50), (52, 50, 48), (50, 98, 2), (100, 100, 0)]', where a '0' in the length (3rd field) will denote all numbers greater. 
Write the code to fill out all ranges. Note that there may be empty space between parts as well.

To complete the map sections so that they cover all possible ranges, we need to add entries to each map that fill in the gaps and extend the ranges where necessary. We will insert tuples for uncovered ranges and add a tuple at the end of each map to denote the continuation for all numbers greater than the highest covered range.

Here's how we can implement this functionality:

Identify Gaps: For each map, check if there are any gaps between the existing ranges.

Fill Gaps and Extend Ranges: Insert new tuples to fill these gaps and add an entry at the end to cover all numbers greater than the highest number in the range.

Sort and Complete the Maps: Ensure that the maps are sorted and complete.

Let's implement these steps in the script:

def complete_maps(maps):
    completed_maps = {}
    for category, map_data in maps.items():
        if not map_data:
            completed_maps[category] = [(0, 0, 0)]  # If map is empty, cover the entire range with itself
            continue

        # Sort the map data by source start value
        map_data.sort(key=lambda x: x[1])
        completed_map = []

        # Add an initial range if necessary
        if map_data[0][1] > 0:
            completed_map.append((0, 0, map_data[0][1]))

        # Fill gaps between existing ranges
        for i in range(len(map_data)):
            completed_map.append(map_data[i])
            if i < len(map_data) - 1 and map_data[i][1] + map_data[i][2] < map_data[i + 1][1]:
                gap_start = map_data[i][1] + map_data[i][2]
                gap_end = map_data[i + 1][1]
                completed_map.append((gap_start, gap_start, gap_end - gap_start))

        # Add a final range if necessary
        last_range_end = map_data[-1][1] + map_data[-1][2]
        completed_map.append((last_range_end, last_range_end, 0))  # 0 in the length field to denote all numbers greater

        completed_maps[category] = completed_map
    
    return completed_maps

# Read data from 'almanac.txt'
almanac_data = read_almanac_from_file('almanac.txt')

seed_ranges, maps = parse_almanac(almanac_data.strip())
completed_maps = complete_maps(maps)

print("Seed ranges:", seed_ranges)
for category, map_data in completed_maps.items():
    print(f"{category}-to map completed:", map_data)

This updated script will fill in the gaps in each map and ensure that the ranges are complete. Run this script with your 'almanac.txt' file to see the completed map data for each section.

You: Excellent! Next, we will need to update the process seed functionality. Because there are so many seeds in the almanac data, we will need to do this work in a more efficient manner. 
First, the map_value function need to change. We are using a seed range now. So, instead of a single value - a range will be returned. These ranges will be used through each subsequent map section. And the final analysis for a singular value will be determined through looking at the lowest value across all the remaining ranges.
To start: change the process_seed and map_value functions to take the new seed_ranges as input. 
The check occurs as such: 
For a given seed range (x to y), determine in which range x and y are located by iterating over the map section's ranges. If x and y are both in the same range, then the range returned is (x, y). If x and y are not in the same range, then the ranges that are covered by x to y must be determined and returned.
For example, if x is in the range a to b, and y is in the range b to c, then 2 ranges: x to b and b to y must be returned.
If  x and y are further separated by an entire range (or ranges) - such as x is in range a to b, there is a range b to c, and y is in the range c to d, then the ranges: x to b, b to c, and y to d must be returned.
change the functionality to do this work. Remember that we now using seed ranges, so 'process_seed' will need to be updated too.

ChatGPT: To adapt the process_seed and map_value functions for handling seed ranges, we'll need to modify their logic significantly. The map_value function will now take a range and return a list of ranges based on the map section. The process_seed function will then process these ranges through each map section.

Let's start with the updated map_value function. This function will take a range (x, y) and iterate over the map section's ranges to find which ranges (x, y) falls into, and return the corresponding ranges.

Then, we'll update the process_seed function to take seed ranges and process them through the map sections, keeping track of the resulting ranges.

Here's how we can implement these changes:

def map_value(range_start, range_end, category_map):
    result_ranges = []
    current_start = range_start

    for dest_start, src_start, length in category_map:
        src_end = src_start + length if length > 0 else float('inf')

        # Check if the current range start is within this mapping range
        if src_start <= current_start < src_end:
            # Determine the end of the range based on the current mapping
            current_end = min(range_end, src_end)
            mapped_start = dest_start + (current_start - src_start)
            mapped_end = dest_start + (current_end - src_start)
            result_ranges.append((mapped_start, mapped_end))

            # Update the current start for the next iteration
            current_start = current_end

        # Break the loop if we have processed the entire range
        if current_start >= range_end:
            break

    return result_ranges

def process_seed(seed_range, maps):
    categories = ["seed", "soil", "fertilizer", "water", "light", "temperature", "humidity", "location"]
    current_ranges = [seed_range]

    for category in categories:
        next_ranges = []
        for r_start, r_end in current_ranges:
            next_ranges.extend(map_value(r_start, r_end, maps.get(category, [])))
        current_ranges = next_ranges

    # Return the final list of ranges after processing through all categories
    return current_ranges

# Example usage with seed ranges and maps
seed_ranges = [(79, 93), (55, 68)]  # Example seed ranges
maps = ...  # Assume maps is defined here

# Process each seed range through the maps
for seed_range in seed_ranges:
    final_ranges = process_seed(seed_range, maps)
    print(f"Final ranges for seed {seed_range}: {final_ranges}")

# To find the lowest value, we can do:
lowest_value = min([r[0] for final_range in final_ranges for r in final_range])
print("Lowest value:", lowest_value)

In this implementation, map_value processes a range through a single category map, returning all the relevant ranges. process_seed takes these ranges and processes them through all categories sequentially. Finally, to find the lowest value, we look at the start of each range in the final list of ranges.

This approach should efficiently handle large numbers of seeds and their ranges. You can integrate this logic into your existing script and test it with your complete 'almanac.txt' file.

You: This returns empty final ranges: "Final ranges for seed (55, 68): []
Final ranges for seed (79, 93): []"
It appears the logic in the map_value function is not working properly.

ChatGPT: Let's review and correct the map_value function. The issue seems to be in how the function handles the ranges and maps them according to the category map. We need to ensure that it correctly identifies and maps the input range (x, y) to the correct output ranges based on the category map.

Here's the revised map_value function:

def map_value(range_start, range_end, category_map):
    result_ranges = []
    i = 0
    map_len = len(category_map)

    while i < map_len and range_start < range_end:
        dest_start, src_start, length = category_map[i]
        src_end = src_start + length if length > 0 else float('inf')

        if src_end <= range_start:
            # Current map range is completely before the input range, skip it
            i += 1
            continue

        if src_start > range_end:
            # Current map range is completely after the input range, break the loop
            break

        # Calculate the overlap of the input range and the current map range
        overlap_start = max(range_start, src_start)
        overlap_end = min(range_end, src_end)

        # Map the overlap to the destination range
        mapped_start = dest_start + (overlap_start - src_start)
        mapped_end = dest_start + (overlap_end - src_start)
        result_ranges.append((mapped_start, mapped_end))

        # Update the range_start for the next iteration
        range_start = overlap_end

        if range_start >= src_end:
            i += 1

    return result_ranges

This updated map_value function should correctly process the input range (x, y) through the category map and return the correct output ranges. It properly handles the overlap of the input range with the map ranges, ensuring that all relevant parts of the input range are mapped.

You can replace the existing map_value function with this revised version and test it with your seed ranges and map data. This should resolve the issue of empty final ranges.

You: Something remains incorrect in this functionality: "Final ranges for seed (79, 93): []
Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "/home/harden/Desktop/adventofai/2023/5/Code/main_part2_try1.py", line 184, in <module>
    lowest_value = min([r[0] for final_range in final_ranges for r in final_range])
ValueError: min() arg is an empty sequence"

ChatGPT: The error indicates that final_ranges is empty, which suggests that the map_value function is not correctly mapping the input range through the category maps, or there's an issue in how the process_seed function is handling these mappings.

To diagnose and fix this, let's take a closer look at both functions and ensure they work as expected:

map_value Function: This function should take a range and map it through a category map. If the input range doesn't overlap with any range in the category map, it should return the input range as-is.

process_seed Function: This function should process a seed range through each category map sequentially. If at any point, no mapping is possible (i.e., map_value returns an empty list), it should stop processing further.

Here's a revised approach to both functions:

Revised map_value Function
def map_value(range_start, range_end, category_map):
    result_ranges = []

    for dest_start, src_start, length in category_map:
        src_end = src_start + length if length > 0 else float('inf')

        # Check for overlap with the current map range
        if src_end > range_start and src_start < range_end:
            mapped_start = max(range_start, src_start)
            mapped_end = min(range_end, src_end)

            # Adjust the mapped range to the destination
            offset = mapped_start - src_start
            mapped_start = dest_start + offset
            mapped_end = dest_start + (mapped_end - src_start)

            result_ranges.append((mapped_start, mapped_end))

    return result_ranges if result_ranges else [(range_start, range_end)]

Revised process_seed Function
def process_seed(seed_range, maps):
    categories = ["seed", "soil", "fertilizer", "water", "light", "temperature", "humidity", "location"]
    current_ranges = [seed_range]

    for category in categories:
        next_ranges = []
        for r_start, r_end in current_ranges:
            mapped_ranges = map_value(r_start, r_end, maps.get(category, []))
            next_ranges.extend(mapped_ranges)
        current_ranges = next_ranges

    return current_ranges

Usage
# Example usage with seed ranges and maps
seed_ranges = [(79, 93), (55, 68)]  # Example seed ranges
maps = ...  # Assume maps is defined here

# Process each seed range through the maps
for seed_range in seed_ranges:
    final_ranges = process_seed(seed_range, maps)
    print(f"Final ranges for seed {seed_range}: {final_ranges}")

# To find the lowest value, we can do:
lowest_value = min([r[0] for final_range in final_ranges for r in final_range], default=None)
print("Lowest value:", lowest_value)

With these revisions, the map_value function should now properly map ranges, and process_seed will process these ranges through all category maps. The min function also includes a default parameter to avoid errors if the list is empty.

Please try this revised approach and see if it resolves the issue.

You: That does seem to have resolved the issue. But, there is an error in determining the lowest value: "Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "/home/harden/Desktop/adventofai/2023/5/Code/main_part2_try1.py", line 169, in <module>
    lowest_value = min([r[0] for final_range in final_ranges for r in final_range], default=None)
  File "/home/harden/Desktop/adventofai/2023/5/Code/main_part2_try1.py", line 169, in <listcomp>
    lowest_value = min([r[0] for final_range in final_ranges for r in final_range], default=None)
TypeError: 'int' object is not subscriptable"

ChatGPT: The error message suggests that the list comprehension is trying to subscript an integer, which is not possible. This indicates an issue with how we are iterating over final_ranges in the list comprehension. We need to ensure that we are correctly iterating over a list of ranges, where each range is a tuple.

If final_ranges is a list of tuples, the comprehension [r[0] for final_range in final_ranges for r in final_range] should work correctly. However, if final_ranges is not a list of tuples, but instead a list of integers, this comprehension would fail.

To fix this, let's ensure that final_ranges is always a list of tuples. If final_ranges contains only a single tuple or a single integer, the list comprehension needs to be adjusted accordingly.

Here's the corrected approach to find the lowest value:

# Process each seed range through the maps and find the lowest value
lowest_value = float('inf')
for seed_range in seed_ranges:
    final_ranges = process_seed(seed_range, maps)
    for final_range in final_ranges:
        # Ensure that final_range is a tuple
        if isinstance(final_range, tuple):
            lowest_value = min(lowest_value, final_range[0])
        else:  # If final_range is a single value
            lowest_value = min(lowest_value, final_range)

if lowest_value == float('inf'):
    lowest_value = None  # or set to an appropriate default value

print("Lowest value:", lowest_value)

This modification should correctly handle final_ranges, whether it is a list of tuples or a list of integers, and find the lowest value accordingly. Please try this corrected approach in your script.
